1.You can configure Spring Security to detect the submission of an invalid session ID
and redirect the user to an appropriate URL. This is achieved through the session-management element:

    #session out time set for user
    server.servlet.session.timeout=1

2.When Is the Session Created?
We can control exactly when our session gets created and how Spring Security will interact with it:

    always – a session will always be created if one doesn't already exist
    ifRequired – a session will be created only if required (default)
    never – the framework will never create a session itself but it will use one if it already exists
    stateless – no session will be created or used by Spring Security
